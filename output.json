                "Came back to this in honor of nates time in the UFC. The guy is an absolute warrior, I don't know if he even feels pain in his face I can't say for sure but the guy is almost genuinely unfinishable. The doctors have to step in and say 'mate, your face is gonna fall off if you carry on. I'm stopping it.' Connor was absolutely at his peak at this point, he hit nate hard, accurate, and thought he would put him away. Man should've done his research... You don't just put nate away. What a fucking fight he was. Cheers for all the entertaining fights nate, you were a real one."
